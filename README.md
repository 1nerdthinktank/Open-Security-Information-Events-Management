# OpenSIEM
Building my own SIEM for educational purposes.

Exploring and researching other free and open source SIEM such as OSSIM, ELK, Graylog, Wuzah, Snort, Security Onion, MozDef.

Also compare cutting edge closed source industry leaders such as Palo Alto, CrowdStrike, Microsoft, Fortinet.

Then I will plan my own project.
